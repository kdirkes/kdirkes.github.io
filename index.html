                <p> My name is Kennedy Dirkes and I am a first year at Occidental College. I am a math major with a minor in education and I want to teach secondary mathmatics in the future. I am interested in also persuing reasearch in education as I have been working on various projects in high school and college revolving around the importance of student voice.</p>
